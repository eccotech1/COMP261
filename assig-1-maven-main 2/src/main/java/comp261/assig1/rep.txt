What my program does:\
  * Reads the data and draws a map\
  * Constructs a graph stucture using collections\
  * Map can be panned and zoomed using buttons or the mouse\
  * trips can be higlighted, edges are built and highlights them\
  * Trie used for road lookup, returning exact match or partial matches\
      * Partial matches from trie lookup are displayed within the text box\
\
What my program accomplished do:\
  * all of core and completion and only the mouse-scroll part of Challenge\
\
Data structures used:\
  * Hashmaps for constant search/storing of data by ID\
  * Lists for storing stops\
  * Trie for looking up road names by prefix\
  * Simple data structures (holding basic information such as stop/trip IDs and other\
    descriptors) were used. They each have methods for drawing to the screen.\
\
How I tested my program:\
  *Given that my program only worked on the ECS machines, I only got the chance to work\
	on it in school.
