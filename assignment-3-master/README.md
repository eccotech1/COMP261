Things done: Core and Completion
Did not attempt: Challenge

For Core I have used: BFS (Breath First Search) to search for the maximum flow by looking for the bottle Neck Value of each
Augmentation Path and adding it up. 
bfs, calcMaxFlow and flowPath are finished up. 
Implemented the Edmond-Karp Method.
For Completion I used:
The max flow of the given Network using the Minimum cut vertex method. 
The methods coded for that are the minCut st and the dfs ) method which is  I have added the radio Buttons to change the weights of the edges.
Challenge
Not attempted, Due to lack of time
